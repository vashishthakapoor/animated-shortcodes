## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vashishthakapoor/animated-shortcodes/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

This is a wordpress plugin to help you create animated shortcodes buttons and content builder sections for your website/blog. You can visit my blog at [vashishthakapoor.com](https://vashishthakapoor.com) to see the live preview of the same. 

It does wonders to make your website much better and look attractive by the use of hover.css, animate.css and wow.js.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
The code works something like that
'
<a href="#">Start Now</a>
'
will be changed to 
' <a href="#" class="button-red hvr-shrink wow bounce">Start Now</a> '

And adding css class to an element, I could make it much eye-catching and beautiful. Specially for WordPress.

It uses

- animate.css
- hover.css

and 

- wow.js

This is what being done on my live website and you can easily have a look at it.

Coming up in the plugin

1. Shortcode Awesomeness
2. Use of wow.js
3. Use of Animate.css
4. Use of hover.css

I am also planning to use scrollmagic.js in this project. You can also contribute to this project. 

Thank you
```
